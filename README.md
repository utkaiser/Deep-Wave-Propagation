# Fast, Accurate, and Scalable Numerical Wave Propagation: Enhancement by Deep Learning (Code)

This repository contains notebooks that explain the Python code of my master's thesis.
We combine wave propagation algorithms 
with machine learning components to reduce the computation time.

We provided simple notebooks that introduce the key topics such as:<br>
- use of numerical algorithms (velocity Verlet and pseudo-spectral method)
- generate data (initial condition and wave profile)
- train end-to-end model
- Parareal scheme.
